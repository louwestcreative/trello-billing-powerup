  <h1>Privacy Policy for Trello Billing Power-Up</h1>

  <p>Last updated: December 1, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Trello Billing Power-Up ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use the Power-Up within Trello.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trello Card Data:</strong> We read and write billing-related information stored on Trello cards, such as payment amounts, categories, and time tracking data.</li>
    <li><strong>Toggl Data:</strong> With your explicit permission, we access Toggl project and time tracking data to synchronize hours billed.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Identifiers:</strong> We do not collect or store personal information beyond what you enter into Trello cards or provide through Toggl integration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Your data is used solely to provide billing tracking and reporting functionality within the Trello Power-Up. We do not share your data with third parties except as required for integration with Toggl.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All billing information is stored securely within Trello's data storage APIs (shared and private storage). Any data transmitted between Trello, Toggl, and our service uses secure HTTPS connections. We do not store sensitive payment information like credit card numbers.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>You control your data via Trello. Removing billing information from cards or disconnecting Toggl will stop data collection. You can request deletion of any stored data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@louwestcreative.com">info@louwestcreative.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This Power-Up integrates with Toggl for time tracking. Please refer to Toggl’s privacy policy for how they handle your data: <a href="https://toggl.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://toggl.com/privacy-policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your data stored by this Power-Up. Contact us for any requests or concerns.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@louwestcreative.com">info@louwestcreative.com</a>.</p>
